            <p class="party"> I'm a <strong>strategic evangelist</strong> who guides companies to establish a corporate vision that will help them to be resilient in the dynamic world by embracing the design driven approach. 
                As someone with a technical background, I can comprehend and actively contribute to the development of a <strong><em>customer-oriented mindset by  facilitating co-creation</em></strong>  in the organization. I am currently studying <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/strategic-product-design/msc-strategic-product-design" target="_blank">Strategic Product Design</a> at TU Delft.
                </p>
                
            <p class="party2">Design-driven approach is, in my opinion, flexible and agile way of working that companies should adopt to excel in the market. As a strategic designer I want to be the catalyst that helps the companies to achieve this goal.
